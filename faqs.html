      <h1>FAQs</h1>
      <p><strong>Can I bring a plus one?</strong><br>No! That’s why your invite doesn’t say plus one. We wish we could invite everyone’s guests but numbers are tight, and we want to celebrate with our closest friends and family.</p>
      <p><strong>Are kids invited?</strong><br>This again? Read the invite. (We love your little ones, but this will be an adult celebration.)</p>
      <p><strong>Is there parking at the venue?</strong><br>Yes, plenty! But we recommend using our transport options for ease (and more poncha).</p>
      <p><strong>Will it be warm?</strong><br>Generally, yes — but Santana is on the north side of the island and can be chilly at night, so bring a layer!</p>
      <p>Still unsure? Ask Eddie.</p>
