    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Quinta do Furão<br>Estrada da Quinta do Furão Nº6, 9230-082 Santana, Madeira</p>

    <h2>Transport</h2>
    <p>We will be providing transportation to and from the wedding with two designated collection hotel points in Funchal — one in the Lido area and one in the city centre. Further information will appear on this page closer to the time.</p>

    <h2>Dress Code</h2>
    <p>We want you to feel relaxed and comfortable, but please dress to impress — there will be plenty of photos and plenty of dancing!</p>

    <h2>Accommodation</h2>
    <p>Madeira has a wide selection of fantastic hotels, particularly in the capital, Funchal, which we personally recommend. While there are limited rooms available at the wedding venue itself, Santana — although stunning in its landscape — is otherwise a little quiet. If you're unsure, ask Eddie!</p>

    <h2>Gift Preference</h2>
    <p>Your presence is more than enough, but if you would like to give something, a contribution towards our honeymoon would mean so much to us… We don’t often get the chance to travel.</p>
